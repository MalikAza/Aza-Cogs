# IDiceBattle - Dice Multiplayer RPG
IDiceBattle is a cog for [Red Discord Bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) that implements a complete multiplayer RPG of dices

## The Game
The principle of the game is really easy: you duel people using dices, but because it's a RPG and it's multiplayer you have many features :
* PvE : Duel the bot for free to get some experience, each duel won will reward you 1XP
* PvP : Duel your opponent with a bet to get much more experience and win money, each duel won will reward you 10XP
* Evolving dices: We talked about how you learn experience, but not it's utility. After a certain amount of experience, you will level up and get some bonus like for example a +1 to all your dice, making you stronger to duel your opponents. 
* Profile view: you can spy other user profiles to see their level and the bonus on their dice, or to see yours.
* V10 Dice: the game use a V10 dice who is an improve of the 10 dice, adding critical success, failure and critical failure which add fun to it. You can see more about it at [rolz.org](https://rolz.org/wiki/page?w=help&n=BasicCodes)
* Stats: You can see yours or someone else stats with some curve and bar graphs !
